  <p>My name is De Wet Blomerus (sounds like "The Vet").</p>

  <p>
    I am married to my best friend, Marysol. We live in Atlanta
    and together we are raising our three young kids.

  <p>
    I am an audio book devourer, burger connoisseur, and a couple times per week you can
    find me in front of our house trying to perfect a wheelie on my bicycle.

    I have worked in tech roles since 2010, currently I am a Software Engineer. I enjoy the whole process. Lots of
    conversations with people to figure out what they need. Coming up with and iterating on the technical solution until
    everyone is bought in. Writing the code to make it happen. And the excitement when it actually improves people's
    lives.

    This is my <a href="blog">blog</a>. It is focused on all things
    code and sometimes the bigger picture around software.
