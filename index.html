  <p>My name is De Wet Blomerus (sounds like "The Vet").</p>

  <p>
    I am married to my best friend, Marysol. We live in Atlanta
    and together we are raising our three young kids.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am an audio book devourer, burger connoisseur, and a couple times per week you can
    find me in front of our house trying to perfect a wheelie on my bicycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a software developer and mentor. I have worked in tech roles since 2010 and have over 10,000 hours
    of experience â€‹solving problems using technology. I really enjoy the
    start-to-finish process of listening to others to get to the bottom of the
    problem we are trying to solve. Then coming up with a technical solution that everyone feels confident about.
    And then writing the code to make it happen.

  <p>
    This is my <a href="blog">blog</a>. It is focused on all things
    code and sometimes the bigger picture around software.
