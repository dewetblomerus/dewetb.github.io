  <p>My name is De Wet Blomerus (sounds like "The Vet").</p>

  <p>
    I am married to my best friend, Marysol.
    We are raising our three children and call Atlanta home.

  <p>
    I am an audiobook devourer, burger connoisseur,
    and a couple of times per week, you can find me in front of our house
    trying to perfect a wheelie on my bicycle.

    I have worked in tech roles since 2007.
    Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer.
    I enjoy the whole process.
    Lots of conversations with people to figure out what we should build.
    Coming up with and iterating on the technical solution
    until everyone buys in.
    Writing the code to make it happen. Mentoring other software engineers.
    And the excitement when the working software improves people's lives.

  <p>
    This is my <a href="blog">blog</a>. I only post sporadically.
    It focuses on all things code
    and sometimes the bigger picture around software creation.
