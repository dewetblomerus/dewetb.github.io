      Hiring De Wet is the easiest decision you'll make. He's great. His work
      ethic and growth mindset make him stand
      out among the many people I've hired.

      De Wet was the engineer I could turn to for any project and trust it would
      be done with quality,
      even when it was a
      technology he had no experience with. When I evaluate engineering
      candidates a major attribute I look for is their
      capacity for continued learning and growth as a sign of longer term
      success on my teams. De Wet exemplifies that
      ability
      to continuously grow and stretch his abilities day after day. Beyond his
      own growth, De Wet also saw the value in
      growing his teammates and invested in their growth almost as much as in
      his own.

      He worked exactly as specified, communicated clearly and executed fast.
      I'd definitely hire him again and probably
      will if this project goes to stage 2. I could not think of a
      better-skilled communicator who handles
      responsibility that well.

      De Wet's honest and simple approach to problem solving was a breath of
      fresh air. The work was completed at a very
      high standard and best of all within timeframe and budget.

      De Wet is a progressive leader and trainer in the IT field. He has a
      proven track record in training and mentoring
      people from complete novices into highly sought after employees. His
      ability to work cross culturally has stood
      him in good stead in the South African context. His ability to pass on
      technical skills and the soft skills is a
      unique and valuable mix. De Wet is a person of great resourcefulness and
