<h1>I am a Professional Geek</h1>

<p>
  I work full time for <a href='https://salesloft.com/' target='_blank'>SalesLoft</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ruby, Rails and React pay the bills while keeping it fun.</li>
  <li>I am actively working to become an Elixir & Phoenix expert. I consume technical content daily to gain the
    knowledge, and I volunteer for Elixir projects at work so that I can do the reps.</li>
  <li>At some point in my life I need to figure out if Machine Learning Engineer is something I can see myself doing in
    a future
    chapter in my career. Maybe Elixir NX will make this more palatable.</li>
</ul>

      He worked exactly as specified, communicated clearly and executed fast. I'd definitely hire him again and probably
      will if this project goes to stage 2. I could not think of a better-skilled communicator who handles
      responsibility that well.
