title: Why We Sleep
---

My life was heavily influenced by the book [Why We sleep](https://www.audible.com/pd/Why-We-Sleep-Audiobook/B0752ZQR33){:target="\_blank"}

The main thing I took from the book is a change in how I view sleep time.

- I used to view sleep like a jar of goodness that I can take time out of to allocate to other things, I'll pay for it with discomfort and maybe some minimal health risks, but if the other thing is more important at that time it's an okay choice.
- Now I view sleep as a force multiplier. The more of it I can generate, the more effective I can be.

### What I do to get more sleep?

- All my electronic devices automatically cuts off the internet from 21:30 to 5:00 the next morning.
- I have super bright 5000k daylight light bulbs in the office and work facing a window.
- From about 9pm onwards I only use very warm colored amber light bulbs and red night lights to promote melatonin production.
- I use blue blocking glasses before bed to give everything a warm orange glow.
- At 9:30pm I stop whatever I am doing and start getting ready for bed, this is really difficult sometimes.

### How is it working?

I fall alseep really easily, often within 30 minutes of getting in bed. But while I sometimes get about 8 hours of sleep, I often wake up 6-7 hours later and can't get back to sleep. Now and then I wake up 4-5 hours later and can't get back to sleep, it is rare but I really feel it on those days.
